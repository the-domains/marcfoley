Tjibbe Joustra, the chairman of the Dutch safety board, said the Malaysia Airlines plane was hit by a 9N314M warhead on 17 July 2014, as it flew at 33,000ft (10,000 metres) above eastern[Ukraine][0]. The warhead was fitted to a "9M28 missile" fired from a Russian-built Buk missile system, he confirmed.

Speaking in front of the reconstructed plane -- pieced together from parts of recovered debris, fitted around a metal skeleton -- Joustra said all other scenarios to explain the disaster, which killed all 298 people on board, had been ruled out.

An animated video was shown to journalists at the Gilze-Rijen airbase in the[Netherlands][1], where the plane was part reassembled over three months. It showed the Buk missile exploding on the left-hand side of the cockpit. Thousands of metal objects were ejected, with hundreds then penetrating the plane with tremendous force, Joustra said.
